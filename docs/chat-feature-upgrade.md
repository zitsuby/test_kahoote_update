# Enhanced Chat Feature Documentation

## Overview

The chat feature has been upgraded with several advanced capabilities to improve communication during quiz sessions. The key enhancements include:

1. **Notifications** - Visual and audio alerts for new messages
2. **Important Message Highlighting** - Host can mark critical messages  
3. **Online Status** - See who's currently active in the chat
4. **Chat Templates** - Quick selection of common messages for hosts
5. **Read Receipts** - See who has read your messages

## Database Setup

To implement these enhancements, additional tables were added to the database:

1. `game_chat_read_receipts` - Tracks who has read each message
2. `game_chat_user_status` - Maintains online status of users
3. Updates to `game_chat_messages` - Added fields for important messages and read receipts

Run the SQL migration script to set up these tables:

```bash
# Run the SQL migration script using Supabase SQL Editor
# Copy the contents of scripts/08-add-chat-feature.sql into the SQL Editor
```
